# While Loop Challenge

Step 1 is to create a method called isEvenNumber, that takes a parameter of type int.
Its purpose is to determine if the argument passed to the method is  an even number or not. 
Return true from the method, if it's an even number, otherwise return false.
Next, use a while loop to test a range of numbers, from 5, up to and including 20, but printing out only the even numbers, determined by the call to the isEvenNumber method.

Step 2 is to modify the while code.
Make it also record the total number of even numbers it has found.
Break out of the loop, once 5 even numbers are found.
Finally, display the total number of odd and even numbers found.
